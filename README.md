# SimiC-Suite

SimiC-Suite is a reproducible framework for phenotype-specific gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis from single-cell RNA-seq data.

The suite comprises two complementary software packages:

| Package | Language | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| SimiCPipeline | Python | Phenotype-specific GRN inference and Regulon Activity Score (RAS) calculation |
| SimiCviz | R / Bioconductor | Tool-agnostic assessment and visualization of GRN outputs |

Together, these packages support reproducible GRN inference, RAS calculation, regulatory dissimilarity analysis, and downstream visualization across Python and R workflows.

## Components

### SimiCPipeline (Python)

📦 Repository: https://github.com/ML4BM-Lab/SimiCPipeline

SimiCPipeline is a modular Python framework for phenotype-specific GRN inference based on the previously published SimiC method (Peng et al., 2022).

Key functionality includes:

- Data preprocessing and imputation
- Automated hyperparameter tuning
- Phenotype-specific GRN inference
- Network filtering and quality assessment
- Regulon Activity Score (RAS) calculation
- Integration with the scverse ecosystem
- Containerized execution via Docker

---

### SimiCviz (R / Bioconductor)

📦 Repository: https://github.com/ML4BM-Lab/SimiCviz

SimiCviz is a tool-agnostic R package for the assessment and visualization of GRN outputs.

In addition to SimiCPipeline outputs, SimiCviz accepts outputs from other GRN inference methods that can be represented as TF-by-target weight matrices, including frameworks such as SCENIC and Pando.

Key functionality includes:

- Parallelized Regulon Activity Score (RAS) calculation
- Regulatory dissimilarity analysis
- Empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) visualization of RAS distributions
- TF-target weight exploration
- Regulatory activity heatmaps
- UMAP visualization
- Import and export utilities
- Integration with Bioconductor workflows
